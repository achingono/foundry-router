# Configuration

## Status: Partially implemented

Configuration is externalized through validated environment variables and dotenv values. Secrets must come from environment variables, Azure Container Apps secrets, or managed identity where supported. They must never be committed to source, Git history, images, logs, or diagnostic responses. Routing and credit settings are currently schema-only and are not runtime behavior.

## Backend and Model Pools

The configuration must support an arbitrary number of backends and an independent backend pool per model. A backend should identify subscription, project, region, endpoint, and deployment even if the first release uses only two subscriptions. Forwarding-capable backends require a deployment identifier.

```yaml
backends:
  sub_a:
    endpoint: ${FOUNDRY_A_ENDPOINT}
    credential: ${FOUNDRY_A_CREDENTIAL}
models:
  gpt-5.4:
    backends:
      sub_a: {weight: 1}
```

The initial logical model set is `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.4-nano`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.2-chat`, and `text-embedding-3-large`.

## Core Settings

The implementation validates client authentication, reconciliation interval, minimum credit reserve in dollars and percent, retry attempts and maximum delay, logging level, pricing, per-backend cycle start day, backend API version, and whether protected backends may be emergency fallbacks. Pricing values are local estimates; zero is valid for an uncharged dimension. The effective reserve and dynamic reserve behavior remain Planned.

## Authoritative Data

Keep these sources separate:

- Authoritative configuration.
- Authoritative Azure usage and cost data.
- Locally estimated usage and cost.
- Ephemeral health, cooldown, and inflight reservation state.

Local estimates must be labeled as estimates and must never be presented as exact balances.
